ble-sensor-pi
=============

Simple example for SensorTag with RaspberryPi a Bluetooth Low Engery (BLE GATT) device.

See sensortag/sensortag_test.py for a simple example of reading temperature values from the tag. The same approach could be used to read any of the sensors.  It's also possible to have the tag send a stream of measurements at regular intervals.  See the information here -
  http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/SensorTag_User_Guide
Or wait for me to add more examples.

This code was thrown together quickly to see how easy it might be to use these devices with the RaspberryPi.  It proved to be very easy - though I struggled to find much information on BLE on Linux.  Other relevant search terms are GATT.

I'll post more information on my blog at http://mike.saunby.net

You will almost certainly need to install a newer version of gatttool for this code to work.  Bluez-5.2 and later are known to work. It's probably best to download and install the latest version of Bluez.

Once unpacked do the following -

    ./configure --disable-systemd
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo /usr/bin/install -c attrib/gatttool /usr/local/bin/gatttool

You're also going to need to install the python pexpect library -

    sudo pip install pexpect

To enable the bluetooth adaptor and find your SensorTag device address do the following -

    sudo hciconfig hci0 up
    sudo hcitool lescan 

Press the side button and you should get a couple of lines showing the device is working. Hit Ctrl-C to exit.  Now you're ready to go -

    python sensortag.py [ADDRESS] [LOGFILE]

In order to use the Node.js socket.io application, node.js, express webframework and socket.io need to be installed (compare example on http://socket.io/get-started/chat/):
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo apt-get install npm
    cd node_socketio_demo
    npm install --save express
    npm install --save socket.io
    node app.js    


I've put this code under the Apache 2.0 licence, if folks want to use it and that 
doesn't suit let me know.  I have no desire to profit from this code, nor prevent others using or profiting if they wish.  Equally you shouldn't expect me to maintain or support it.  It's just stuff, use it as you wish.
